# Five-CVE Pilot Selection Plan
**Status:** Selection criteria established; CVEs not yet selected or analyzed.

## Purpose
Test the coding framework rather than prove the research hypothesis. Use the official CISA KEV Catalog as the candidate frame and retain its retrieval date.

## Eligibility
- CVE is present in the dated KEV snapshot.
- Affected product and vendor can be identified.
- At least one publicly accessible official vendor or government/CSIRT source is discoverable, or its unavailability is explicitly recorded for a screened candidate.
- Sufficient product context exists to assess at least some applicability categories.

## Diversity targets
Select five cases spanning at least three product categories (e.g., network appliance, enterprise server/software, endpoint/client, cloud/service, identity/access) where available; vary vulnerability mechanisms and response implications. Do not deliberately choose cases because their advisories appear weak or strong.

## Candidate log columns
`cve_id,kev_snapshot_date,product_category,vulnerability_mechanism,vendor_source_url,government_source_url,screening_result,reason,selected_pilot`

## Selection workflow
1. Download or record the official KEV catalog snapshot and date.
2. Screen a manageable candidate pool against eligibility.
3. Select five cases for diversity, with written reasons.
4. Register all official documents, then time retrieval and coding.
5. Record problems and revise rules before selecting up to 20 additional CVEs.

**Important:** No actual pilot CVEs have been verified or selected in this file; do not describe the pilot as completed.
